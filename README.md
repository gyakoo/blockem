# blockem
Simple game created for testing Python/PyGame
You have to clear the level by flying with your little friend and touching white block to turn them into yellow ones.<br/>
Be careful, once they're yellow if you touch them again, they'll turn in angry red ones.<br/>
Difficulty hasn't been adjusted so you'll expect very hard levels.
